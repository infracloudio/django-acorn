# Acorn for Django sample app - Vote App

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

This is an Acorn for the sample Django Vote app following Django's Offical [Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/).This sample Vote app lets people view polls and vote in them. An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
